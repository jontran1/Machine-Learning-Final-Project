# Machine Learning Final Project

### Predicting Rents



#### Abstract:

​	Data collected from StreetEasy will be used to train various models. These models will be trained using various features. How the features will be selected will be described in the following paper. 

I will use these models to predict the rent on unseen data and determine how accurate the model is. What I am trying to do here is gain a better understanding of statistics and machine learning in general. Each model used in this paper will have its disadvantages and advantages explained and my best attempt at explaining why some models perform better then others. 

​	Due to the data set having multiple features, this is most likely is a nth dimension problem, so I believe a linear regression will give us an "ok" prediction. A more complex solution maybe needed. 

​	The target being a continuous variable will require a regression analysis, since this is not a classification problem.
